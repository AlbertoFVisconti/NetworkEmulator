# 🛰️ NetworkEmulator

**NetworkEmulator** is a Python-based tool that emulates custom network topologies using **Mininet**, based on definitions written in **YAML**. It supports automatic router and host configuration, topology visualization via **GraphViz**, and routing using shortest-path algorithms.

---

## 📦 Features

- Parses network topology from a YAML file
- Automatically builds Mininet emulations with hosts, routers, and layer-2 switches
- Computes routing tables using **Dijkstra's algorithm** based on link costs
- Outputs a GraphViz-compatible network diagram with the `--draw` option
- Supports virtual environments with fixed, allowed dependencies

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
sudo venv/bin/python3 emulation.py [options] topology.yaml
```

### Options

| Flag        | Description                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help message and exit                              |
| `-d`, `--draw` | Output a router-only GraphViz map to `stdout`          |

## 📁 Files in this Repo

- `emulation.py` — Main script that sets up the emulated network
- `topology.yaml` — Input YAML file describing routers and hosts
- `graph.dot` — Example GraphViz output generated by `--draw`
- `requirements.txt` — List of allowed Python packages

---

## 🔧 Running in a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create and activate the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install allowed packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the script (requires sudo)
sudo venv/bin/python3 emulation.py topology.yaml
```

> ℹ️ You must run `emulation.py` with `sudo` to launch Mininet.

## 🖼️ Topology Visualization

To generate a GraphViz representation of the network (routers only):

```bash
sudo venv/bin/python3 emulation.py --draw topology.yaml > graph.dot
```

Then render it using GraphViz:

```bash
dot -Tpng graph.dot -o graph.png
```

---

## ✅ Assumptions

- Router and host names **do not** match the pattern `s[0-9]+` (reserved for auto-added switches)
- YAML is guaranteed to be well-formed with no duplicate IPs
- Each interface connects to at least one other (host or router)
- All routing is based on the **minimum total cost**
